An explanation of changes made to files outside of the main database.py

FILE: routes.py
CHANGE: Get car availability
DETAILS: In the list_cars function code was added to call a new function; get_car_availability from the database.py file. 
This gets the cars availability for the current day and loads it into the car_details.html file which displays it to the user.

FILE: routes.py
CHANGE: Update session homebay
DETAILS: A line of code was added to call a new update_session_homebay function in the database.py file. This stores the new 
homebay value in the session variable.

FILE: routes.py
CHANGE: Update session stat number of bookings
DETAILS: A line of code was added to call a new update_session_stat_nrofbookings function in the database.py file. This 
updates the session value to reflect the current number of bookings.

FILE: routes.py
CHANGE: New booking error messages and redirect
DETAILS: In the new_booking function elif statements were added to display a new message "Car is already booked by another 
member, or you already have a booking, at this time", if the car or user is already booked. This is more informative for the
user than a basic error message. The url redirect after a successful booking was also changed to reflect the design brief. It
now links to a summary screen of the successful booking.

FILE: car_details.html
CHANGE: Availability for today
DETAILS: Two new tables were created which displays the result from the get_car_availability function in the database.py file.
This information is displayed the table with the times printed for the current day and whether the car is booked or available.

FILE: bay_details.html
CHANGE: Walkscore and map url
DETAILS: Walkscore and map url were moved from the car details page to the car bay page as in the brief and the fact that
 they are more relevant when displayed there. The HTML was slightly adjusted to make the url as a clickable link which opens 
in a new tab.

FILE: bay_list.html
CHANGE: Message when no search results
DETAILS: An if statement has been added to the file to display a short message when there are no bays matching the users search.
This is a small but important design detail to let the user know the search has been carried out but no results were found.

FILE: main.js
CHANGE: New file created in static/scripts folder
DETAILS: A small javascript file was created to hold a javascript function which limits the date picker on the 'new booking' page.
This prevents the users from making a booking in the past by greying out past dates so the cannot be selected.

FILE: top.html
CHANGE: Added script line to link the new main.js file
DETAILS: An extra line of code was added to link the new main.js file to the html. This means the function that restricts the
datepicker when making a new booking can be found and called when necessary.
